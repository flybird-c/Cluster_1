# Island Adventures - Shipwrecked

### A modification for Don't Starve Together

The aim of this mod is to bring the content from the Don't Starve DLC "Shipwrecked" to Don't Starve Together, also adapting and tuning it to suit multiplayer better. All of the content is based on Shipwrecked, there are no completely new features included.

>Donâ€™t let the tropical breeze lull you into a false sense of security - the world might be different, but it is still equal parts unforgiving and uncompromising. You will quickly find these islands are full to the brim with things that want to kill you.
